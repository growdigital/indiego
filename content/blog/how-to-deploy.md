Indiego is designed to be easy to deploy. Using The Power of [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), a rather splendid website deployment service, you can have your own site up and running within 2 minutes! No, really. 

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) account.
2. Click the Deploy button on [Indiego home page](https://www.indiego.org.uk/) (or use this one: [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/growdigital/indiego))
3. Connect Netlify to GitHub or GitLab
4. Name your project repository
5. YOU HAVE DEPLOYED!!

Obviously, Indiego is just a starter kit, so you will need to enter your details in the configuration file [config.yml](). That is the subject of the _next_ thrilling instalment of Working with Indiego.
